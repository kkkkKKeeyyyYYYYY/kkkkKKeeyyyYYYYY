## My Projects

### Echo Bloom: The Cosmic Game
Echo Bloom is a puzzle/strategy game where players plant and arrange sound seeds to create harmonious compositions in a cosmic garden. Each seed has a unique sound and color, and players must strategize to avoid noise pollution and use special power-ups. The game features dynamic environments, seasonal gardens, and an adaptive music system.
